### **Jack Reacher: One morning in an ordinary town, five people are shot dead in a seemingly random attack; all evidence points to a single suspect: an ex-military sniper who is quickly brought into custody; Reacher, an enigmatic ex-Army investigator, believes the authorities have the right man but agrees to help the sniper's defense attorney.. However, the more Reacher delves into the case, the less clear-cut it appears.**
